# Readme

- This repository contains various codes that I have written to extract, clean, re-organize, and analyze data.   
- In this readme file, I briefly describe what each file in each folder does.     
- Since Github does not allow users to upload single files larger than 100 MB, datasets are not uploaded. I will provide the data files upon request. Comments are welcomed.
