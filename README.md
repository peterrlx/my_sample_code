# Readme

- This repository contains various codes that I have written to extract, clean, re-organize, and analyze data for RA work, course projects, or other purposes.   
- In this readme file, I briefly describe what each file in each folder does.     
- Since Github does not allow users to upload single files larger than 100 MB, datasets related to the code commands are not included in this repo. I will provide the data files upon request. 

<!-- ## RA work-->




## Course projects or homework

- `fin065_vc_hw.do`: Homework for venture capital course. The dateset given is US venture capital investments from the VentureXpert database. The requirement is to perform some basic data analysis (e.g., compute the number of startups that have exited through IPO or acquisitions, investigate whether CVC-backed startups are more likely to exit through IPO than VC-backed startups, etc.). 
- `ec530_applied_micro_hw.do`: Homework for applied micro course. The problem set is based on the paper Almond, Chay, and Lee (2005). The requirement is to estimate the causal effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on infant birthweight and other infant health outcomes based on propensity score approach. The data for the problem set is an extract of all births from the 1993 National Natality Detail Files for Pennsylvania. Each observation represents an infant-mother match.
- `macro_RBC_habit_BK.m`: Homework 5 for advanced macro I. It solves a RBC model with habit formation by BK method.
