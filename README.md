# Readme

This repository contains the codes that I have written to extract, clean, organize, and analyze data.   
In this readme file, I briefly describe what each file in each folder does.     
Since Github does not allow users to upload single files larger than 100 MB and some of my data files are large, some coding scripts cannot be directly executed. If it is necessary, I will provide the data files upon request.
